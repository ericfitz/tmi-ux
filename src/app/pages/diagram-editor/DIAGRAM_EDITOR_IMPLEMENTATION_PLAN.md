# Diagram Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the diagram editor, designed to enable local editing first while building a foundation for collaborative editing in the future.

## Implementation Progress and Notes

### Completed Items ‚úÖ

- **Diagram Models and Types**
  - Created diagram models based on API schemas
  - Implemented operation-based architecture for diagram changes
  - Set up versioning support for future collaboration

- **Diagram Service**
  - Implemented DiagramService with detailed logging
  - Created event-based notification system
  - Built command pattern for operation history

- **MaxGraph Integration**
  - Successfully initialized maxGraph in the component
  - Created the basic canvas container
  - Added detailed logging for initialization and errors
  - Implemented basic vertex creation

- **Navigation and Structure**
  - Added direct access to diagram editor in navbar
  - Set up routing with proper parameters
  - Temporarily disabled auth guard for testing

### Implementation Patterns and Choices üìù

1. **Event-Based Architecture**
   - Using BehaviorSubjects to synchronize state between components
   - Components subscribe to service observables to receive updates
   - This will simplify future server integration

2. **Operation-Based Editing**
   - All diagram edits are represented as operations (add, update, delete)
   - Operations are recorded in history for undo/redo support
   - Each operation has unique ID, timestamp, and user ID for future conflict resolution

3. **Abstraction Layer**
   - Created an abstraction between graph manipulation and diagram state
   - MaxGraph specifics isolated in DiagramRendererService
   - DiagramService manages logical model independent of rendering

4. **Reactive Programming**
   - Using RxJS for reactive state management
   - Component updates automatically when diagram state changes
   - Will enable real-time updates when collaborative features are added

5. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Detailed, categorized logs for all operations
   - Initialization and error states carefully tracked
   - Will aid in debugging complex interactions

## Remaining Tasks üìã

### Phase 1: Complete Local Diagram Editing

- **Diagram Interactions**
  - Implement selection mechanism ‚è≥
  - Add property editing panel with form controls ‚è≥
  - Create drag-and-drop from palette ‚è≥

- **Edge Creation**
  - Implement visual edge creation between nodes ‚è≥
  - Add validation for connection rules ‚è≥

- **Local Storage**
  - Complete save/load to browser localStorage ‚è≥
  - Add export/import functionality ‚è≥

- **Polish and UX**
  - Add keyboard shortcuts ‚è≥
  - Improve visual feedback during interactions ‚è≥
  - Add animations for smoother experience ‚è≥

### Phase 2: Collaboration-Ready Architecture

- **Enhance DiagramService**
  - Add operation queue for batching changes
  - Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability
  - Finalize versioning support

- **WebSocket Integration**
  - Create WebSocketService for communication
  - Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
  - Add session management capability

- **Operation Transformation**
  - Design operation transformation system
  - Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits
  - Add capability to replay operations

- **UI for Collaboration**
  - Add collaboration status indicators
  - Implement user presence visualization
  - Create collaboration session management UI

## Next Steps Priorities üöÄ

1. Complete vertex creation with proper styling
2. Implement edge creation between vertices
3. Add selection and property editing
4. Implement the palette with drag-and-drop
5. Complete local storage functionality

This plan ensures we can deliver a functional diagram editor quickly while building a strong foundation for future collaborative features.
