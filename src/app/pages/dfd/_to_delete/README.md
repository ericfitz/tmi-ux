# Legacy Files Marked for Deletion

This directory contains legacy files that are no longer used in the codebase and are scheduled for deletion.

## Files in this directory:

### `app-dfd-legacy.facade.ts`

- **Status**: Unused dead code
- **Reason for removal**: Redundant facade service that duplicates functionality already provided by `AppDfdFacade`
- **Analysis**: No imports or usage found anywhere in the codebase
- **Moved on**: 2025-09-25

### `dfd.component.v1.backup.ts`

- **Status**: Backup file from previous architecture
- **Reason for removal**: Legacy component backup no longer needed after v2 architecture implementation
- **Analysis**: Backup of previous DFD component implementation
- **Moved on**: 2025-09-25

## Deletion Process

These files can be safely deleted once:

1. ✅ Confirmed no references exist in the codebase
2. ✅ Build and tests pass without these files
3. ✅ Team review completed

**Safe to delete after**: 30 days from move date (approximately 2025-10-25)

## Validation Commands

Before deletion, run these commands to ensure safety:

```bash
# Check for any remaining references
grep -r "AppDfdLegacyFacade" src/ --exclude-dir=_to_delete
grep -r "dfd.component.v1.backup" src/ --exclude-dir=_to_delete

# Verify build passes
pnpm run build

# Verify tests pass
pnpm run test
```
