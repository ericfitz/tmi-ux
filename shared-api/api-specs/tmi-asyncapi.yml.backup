  title: TMI WebSocket API
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for the Collaborative Threat Modeling Interface (TMI) WebSocket messaging.
    This API enables real-time collaborative editing of threat model diagrams with role-based access control.

    ## Features
    - Real-time collaborative diagram editing
    - Role-based access control (reader/writer/owner permissions)
    - JWT token authentication
    - Session management with automatic cleanup
    - Diagram operation validation

    ## Connection Flow
    1. Authenticate with JWT token
    2. Validate access permissions for the diagram
    3. Join or create collaboration session
    4. Exchange real-time diagram operations
    5. Receive join/leave notifications from other participants

    description: |
      WebSocket endpoint for collaborative diagram editing. Each diagram has its own collaboration session.
      Users must have at least reader permissions on the parent threat model to connect.

      ## Session Management
      - Sessions are automatically created when first client connects
      - Sessions include automatic cleanup after 15 minutes of inactivity
      - Multiple clients can participate in the same session simultaneously
      - Each session tracks active participants and their join times

        Only the host can send this message. When processed, the server will:
        1. Disconnect the specified user from the current session
        2. Add the user to a session-specific deny list
        3. Broadcast a participants_update message to all remaining participants
        
        The removed participant will not be able to rejoin the same session but can
        participate in other collaboration sessions.

      description: |
        JWT token authentication for WebSocket connections. Authentication is handled by 
        server-side middleware that validates JWT tokens provided as query parameters.

        ## Authentication Flow
        1. Client includes JWT token as query parameter: `?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...`
        2. Server middleware validates token and extracts user claims
        3. Server verifies user has at least reader access to the threat model
        4. Server verifies the diagram exists within the specified threat model
        5. WebSocket connection is established if all validations pass

        ## Access Control
        - Users need minimum reader permissions on the parent threat model
        - Diagram must exist within the specified threat model
        - Token must contain valid user identification claims (sub, email)

        Example: ws://localhost:8080/threat_models/123/diagrams/456/ws?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...
