  title: TMI WebSocket API
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for the Collaborative Threat Modeling Interface (TMI) WebSocket messaging.
    This API enables real-time collaborative editing of threat model diagrams with role-based access control.

    ## Features
    - Real-time collaborative diagram editing
    - Role-based access control (reader/writer/owner permissions)
    - JWT token authentication
    - Session management with automatic cleanup
    - Diagram operation validation

    ## Connection Flow
    1. Authenticate with JWT token
    2. Validate access permissions for the diagram
    3. Join or create collaboration session
    4. Exchange real-time diagram operations
    5. Receive join/leave notifications from other participants

    description: |
      WebSocket endpoint for collaborative diagram editing. Each diagram has its own collaboration session.
      Users must have at least reader permissions on the parent threat model to connect.

      ## Session Management
      - Sessions are automatically created when first client connects
      - Sessions include automatic cleanup after 15 minutes of inactivity
      - Multiple clients can participate in the same session simultaneously
      - Each session tracks active participants and their join times

      description: |
        JWT token authentication for WebSocket connections. Authentication is handled by 
        server-side middleware that validates JWT tokens provided as query parameters.

        ## Authentication Flow
        1. Client includes JWT token as query parameter: `?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...`
        2. Server middleware validates token and extracts user claims
        3. Server verifies user has at least reader access to the threat model
        4. Server verifies the diagram exists within the specified threat model
        5. WebSocket connection is established if all validations pass

        ## Access Control
        - Users need minimum reader permissions on the parent threat model
        - Diagram must exist within the specified threat model
        - Token must contain valid user identification claims (sub, email)

        Example: ws://localhost:8080/threat_models/123/diagrams/456/ws?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...

  rateLimited:
    description: |
      This operation is subject to rate limiting and connection management:
      - Message size limit: 4KB per message  
      - Operation size limit: 50KB per operation
      - Read timeout: 60 seconds with ping/pong keepalive
      - Write timeout: 10 seconds per message
      - Session cleanup: 15 minutes after last activity
      - Origin validation in production mode

  validated:
    description: |
      This operation includes comprehensive validation:
      - Operation type must be 'add', 'update', or 'remove'
      - Component IDs must be valid UUIDs (non-zero UUID for cells)
      - Required fields must be present based on operation type
      - Cell properties must meet defined constraints (shape, coordinates, dimensions)
      - Property keys cannot exceed 255 characters
      - Operations are applied to stored diagrams and broadcasted to all participants

  sessionManaged:
    description: |
      This operation participates in session management:
      - Sessions are created automatically when first client connects
      - Multiple clients can join the same session simultaneously
      - Join/leave events are broadcast to all session participants
      - Sessions track participant information and connection times
      - Inactive sessions are cleaned up automatically after 15 minutes
