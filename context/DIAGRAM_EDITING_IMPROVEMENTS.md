# Diagram Editor Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines potential improvements to enhance the diagram editing experience in the application.

## User Interface and Interaction

### Better Selection Feedback
- Add a more prominent highlight effect for selected elements
- Consider showing different selection styles for different element types
- Add subtle animation when elements are selected/deselected

### Improved Drag and Drop
- Add visual snap-to-grid indicators during drag operations
- Implement "smart guides" that appear when elements are aligned
- Show distance measurements when moving elements relative to others

### Contextual Toolbars
- Show a small floating toolbar near the selected element
- Include common operations specific to the selected element type
- Add quick-access buttons for frequent operations (color, style, delete)

### Mini-map Navigation
- Add a small overview map for large diagrams
- Show current viewport and allow click-to-navigate
- Highlight different sections of complex diagrams

## Text and Labels

### Enhanced Label Editing
- Add text formatting options (bold, italic, etc.) in a small toolbar when editing
- Support markdown-like syntax in labels for simple formatting
- Provide font size adjustment directly in the editor
- Implement auto-sizing options with min/max constraints

### Multi-language Support
- Add support for right-to-left languages
- Implement proper text rendering for non-Latin scripts
- Allow per-diagram language settings

## Connections and Relationships

### Connection Improvements
- Add visual preview of connections while dragging
- Implement clearer connection points with hover effects
- Add quick connection type selection (different arrow styles, line types)
- Support for self-connections (loops)

### Routing and Paths
- Implement smarter auto-routing for connections
- Add manual control points for fine-tuning connection paths
- Provide different routing algorithms (straight, orthogonal, curved)

## Advanced Editing Features

### Multi-selection Operations
- Add group/ungroup functionality
- Implement alignment tools (left, right, center, distribute)
- Add bulk property editing for multiple selected elements

### Smart Layout Assistance
- Add auto-layout options for common diagram patterns
- Implement "tidy up" functionality to clean messy diagrams
- Add suggestions for layout improvements

### History and Versioning
- Add a more visible undo/redo UI with operation previews
- Implement named checkpoints or versions of diagrams
- Show visual history timeline of major changes

## Accessibility and Usability

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility
- Create a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts
- Add a keyboard shortcut reference/cheat sheet
- Improve focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard

### Mobile and Touch Improvements
- Optimize touch targets for mobile use
- Add pinch-to-zoom and other touch gestures
- Create a simplified mobile-optimized editing mode
- Support for stylus input with pressure sensitivity

## Performance and Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement virtualization for large diagrams
- Add level-of-detail rendering for zoomed-out views
- Optimize the rendering pipeline for smoother interactions
- Consider WebGL rendering for very large diagrams

### Export and Sharing
- Add more export formats (SVG, PNG, PDF) with customization
- Implement diagram embedding with interactive features
- Add QR code generation for quick mobile viewing
- Support for high-resolution exports

## Customization and Extensibility

### Theming and Customization
- Expand theme options with more visual styles
- Allow saving and sharing of custom themes
- Add per-element style overrides
- Support dark mode and high-contrast themes

### Component Library
- Create a library of reusable diagram components
- Allow users to save custom elements to their library
- Support importing and exporting component libraries
- Add categories and search for large component libraries

## Collaboration Features

### Real-time Collaboration
- Add visual indicators of other users' cursors/selections
- Implement change highlighting to show recent modifications
- Add commenting/annotation features for feedback
- Support for role-based editing permissions

### Version Control Integration
- Add Git-like branching for diagram versions
- Implement visual diff tools to compare diagrams
- Support for merging changes from multiple editors
- Conflict resolution tools for simultaneous edits

## Deletion Flow Improvements

### Issues with Current Deletion Flow
- "Cell does not exist" warnings occur when trying to access data from a deleted cell
- Deletion process doesn't properly clean up all references to deleted cells
- Race conditions between component deletion and cell deletion
- Anchor points may retain references to deleted cells
- Lack of comprehensive cleanup for all references to deleted cells

### Planned Improvements
- Capture all required cell information before deletion
- Implement pre-delete information gathering
- Update vertex and edge deletion to use pre-captured data
- Add cleanup mechanisms for anchor points
- Add transaction boundaries for atomic operations
- Create a centralized reference registry (future enhancement)
- Improve error handling during deletion operations

## Next Steps

The improvements above are organized by category, but implementation should be prioritized based on:

1. User feedback and pain points
2. Development complexity and resource requirements
3. Strategic alignment with product roadmap

For initial implementation, focus on the improvements that provide the highest value with reasonable development effort:

- Enhanced label editing
- Connection improvements
- Better selection feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- Fix deletion flow issues (currently in progress)

These changes would significantly improve the user experience while building a foundation for more advanced features in the future.
