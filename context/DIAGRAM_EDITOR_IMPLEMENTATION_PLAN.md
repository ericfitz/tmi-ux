# Diagram Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the diagram editor, designed to enable local editing first while building a foundation for collaborative editing in the future.

## Implementation Progress and Notes

### Completed Items ‚úÖ

- **Diagram Models and Types**

  - Created cell-based diagram models based on API schemas
  - Implemented operation-based architecture for diagram changes
  - Set up versioning support for future collaboration

- **Diagram Service**

  - Implemented DiagramService with direct cell management
  - Created event-based notification system
  - Built command pattern for operation history

- **MaxGraph Integration**

  - Successfully initialized maxGraph in the component
  - Created the basic canvas container
  - Added detailed logging for initialization and errors
  - Implemented basic vertex creation

- **Navigation and Structure**
  - Added direct access to diagram editor in navbar
  - Set up routing with proper parameters
  - Temporarily disabled auth guard for testing

### Implementation Patterns and Choices üìù

1. **Event-Based Architecture**

   - Using BehaviorSubjects to synchronize state between components
   - Components subscribe to service observables to receive updates
   - This will simplify future server integration

2. **Operation-Based Editing**

   - All diagram edits are represented as operations (add, update, delete)
   - Operations are recorded in history for undo/redo support
   - Each operation has unique ID, timestamp, and user ID for future conflict resolution

3. **Abstraction Layer**

   - Created an abstraction between graph manipulation and diagram state
   - MaxGraph specifics isolated in DiagramRendererService
   - DiagramService manages cell-based model independent of rendering

4. **Reactive Programming**

   - Using RxJS for reactive state management
   - Cell updates propagate through the system via observables
   - Will enable real-time updates when collaborative features are added

5. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Detailed, categorized logs for all operations
   - Initialization and error states carefully tracked
   - Will aid in debugging complex interactions

## Improvement Suggestions üí°

### User Interface and Interaction

#### Better Selection Feedback

- Add a more prominent highlight effect for selected elements
- Consider showing different selection styles for different element types
- Add subtle animation when elements are selected/deselected

#### Improved Drag and Drop

- Add visual snap-to-grid indicators during drag operations
- Implement "smart guides" that appear when elements are aligned
- Show distance measurements when moving elements relative to others

#### Contextual Toolbars

- Show a small floating toolbar near the selected element
- Include common operations specific to the selected element type
- Add quick-access buttons for frequent operations (color, style, delete)

#### Mini-map Navigation

- Add a small overview map for large diagrams
- Show current viewport and allow click-to-navigate
- Highlight different sections of complex diagrams

### Text and Labels

#### Enhanced Label Editing

- Add text formatting options (bold, italic, etc.) in a small toolbar when editing
- Support markdown-like syntax in labels for simple formatting
- Provide font size adjustment directly in the editor
- Implement auto-sizing options with min/max constraints

#### Multi-language Support

- Add support for right-to-left languages
- Implement proper text rendering for non-Latin scripts
- Allow per-diagram language settings

### Connections and Relationships

#### Connection Improvements

- Add visual preview of connections while dragging
- Implement clearer connection points with hover effects

- Support for self-connections (loops)

#### Routing and Paths

- Implement smarter auto-routing for connections
- Add manual control points for fine-tuning connection paths
- Provide different routing algorithms (straight, orthogonal, curved)

### Advanced Editing Features

#### Multi-selection Operations

- Add group/ungroup functionality
- Implement alignment tools (left, right, center, distribute)
- Add bulk property editing for multiple selected elements

#### Smart Layout Assistance

- Add auto-layout options for common diagram patterns
- Implement "tidy up" functionality to clean messy diagrams
- Add suggestions for layout improvements

#### History and Versioning

- Add a more visible undo/redo UI with operation previews
- Implement named checkpoints or versions of diagrams
- Show visual history timeline of major changes

### Accessibility and Usability

#### Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility

- Create a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts
- Add a keyboard shortcut reference/cheat sheet
- Improve focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard

- Add pinch-to-zoom and other touch gestures
- Create a simplified mobile-optimized editing mode
- Support for stylus input with pressure sensitivity

### Performance and Technical Improvements

#### Performance Optimizations

- Implement virtualization for large diagrams

- Support for merging changes from multiple editors
- Conflict resolution tools for simultaneous edits

### Deletion Flow Improvements

#### Issues with Current Deletion Flow

- "Cell does not exist" warnings occur when trying to access data from a deleted cell
- Deletion process doesn't properly clean up all references to deleted cells
- Race conditions during cell deletion process
- Anchor points may retain references to deleted cells
- Lack of comprehensive cleanup for all references to deleted cells

#### Planned Improvements

- Capture all required cell information before deletion
- Implement pre-delete information gathering
- Update vertex and edge deletion to use pre-captured data
- Add cleanup mechanisms for anchor points
- Add transaction boundaries for atomic operations
- Create a centralized reference registry (future enhancement)
- Improve error handling during deletion operations

## Next Steps Priorities üöÄ

Implementation should be prioritized based on:

1. User feedback and pain points
2. Development complexity and resource requirements
3. Strategic alignment with product roadmap

For immediate implementation, focus on:

1. Complete vertex creation with proper styling
2. Implement edge creation between vertices
3. Add selection and property editing
4. Implement the palette with drag-and-drop
5. Complete local storage functionality
6. Enhanced label editing
7. Connection improvements
8. Better selection feedback
9. Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
10. Fix deletion flow issues (currently in progress)

This plan ensures we can deliver a functional diagram editor quickly while building a strong foundation for future collaborative features and enhancements.
