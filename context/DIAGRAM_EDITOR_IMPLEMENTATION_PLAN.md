# Diagram Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the diagram editor, designed to enable local editing first while building a foundation for collaborative editing in the future.

## Implementation Progress and Notes

### Completed Items ‚úÖ

- **Diagram Models and Types**

  - Created node-based diagram models
  - Implemented operation-based architecture for diagram changes
  - Set up versioning support for future collaboration

- **Diagram Service**

  - Implemented DiagramService with node and edge management
  - Created event-based notification system
  - Built command pattern for operation history

- **AntV/X6 Integration**

  - Successfully initialized AntV/X6 in the component
  - Created the basic canvas container
  - Added detailed logging for initialization and errors
  - Implemented node and edge creation
  - Integrated Angular components with `@antv/x6-angular-shape`
  - Implemented NodeRegistryService for proper node shape registration
  - Added PassiveEventHandler for improved performance and browser compatibility

- **Navigation and Structure**

  - Added direct access to diagram editor in navbar
  - Set up routing with proper parameters
  - Temporarily disabled auth guard for testing

- **Palette and Properties Panel**

  - Implemented drag-and-drop palette for node creation
  - Created properties panel for editing node and edge attributes
  - Added support for different node types (process, store, actor)

- **History and Export/Import**
  - Implemented undo/redo functionality using X6's history manager
  - Added export functionality for JSON, PNG, and SVG formats
  - Implemented import functionality for JSON files

### Implementation Patterns and Choices üìù

1. **Event-Based Architecture**

   - Using BehaviorSubjects to synchronize state between components
   - Components subscribe to service observables to receive updates
   - This will simplify future server integration

2. **Operation-Based Editing**

   - All diagram edits are represented as operations (add, update, delete)
   - Operations are recorded in history for undo/redo support
   - Each operation has unique ID, timestamp, and user ID for future conflict resolution

3. **Abstraction Layer**

   - Created an abstraction between graph manipulation and diagram state
   - AntV/X6 specifics isolated in X6GraphService
   - DiagramService manages high-level operations independent of rendering
   - NodeRegistryService provides a clean registration mechanism for node shapes

4. **Reactive Programming**

   - Using RxJS for reactive state management
   - Node and edge updates propagate through the system via observables
   - Will enable real-time updates when collaborative features are added

5. **Comprehensive Logging**

   - Detailed, categorized logs for all operations
   - Initialization and error states carefully tracked
   - Will aid in debugging complex interactions

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - PassiveEventHandler for improved touch and wheel event performance
   - Proper attribute references for node shapes (refWidth, refHeight)
   - Clean initialization sequence to avoid race conditions
