# .clinerules

This file provides guidance to Roo Code when working with code in this repository.

## API and Backend

- Backend API specification is available in `tmi-openapi.json`
- Local development server runs at http://localhost:4200
- API URL is configured in environment files (e.g., environment.dev.ts)
- Authentication and authorization details are documented in `AUTHORIZATION.md` in the contexxt folder
- The server uses a role-based access control model with Owner, Writer, and Reader roles
- Authorization middleware enforces permissions for object access and modification

## Build/Test Commands

- Run all pnpm commands from the project root directory
- Development server: `ng serve` or `pnpm run dev`
- Production build: `ng build --configuration=production` or `pnpm run build:prod`
- Run all tests: `ng test` or `pnpm run test`
- Run single test: `ng test --include=**/path/to/file.spec.ts`
- Run tests for specific component: `ng test --include=**/component-name/*.spec.ts`
- Focus tests in code: Use `describe.only()` and `it.only()` in spec files
- Lint TypeScript/HTML: `pnpm run lint`
- Lint SCSS: `pnpm run lint:scss`
- Lint all files: `pnpm run lint:all`
- Format code: `pnpm run format`
- Check formatting: `pnpm run format:check`
- Check all (lint+format): `pnpm run check`
- Pre-commit hooks: Uses husky and lint-staged to verify code quality before commits (temporarily disabled)

## Code Style

- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Quotes: single quotes for TypeScript
- Max line length: 100 characters
- TypeScript: strict mode enabled with ES modules
- Components: app-prefix selectors, SCSS for styles, OnPush change detection
- Import order: Angular core → Angular modules → Third-party → Project modules
- Observables: Use $ suffix
- Private members: Use \_ prefix
- Error handling: Use catchError with LoggerService
- Type annotations: Use throughout (explicit function return types)
- No explicit any: Avoid using 'any' type
- Documentation: JSDoc style comments
- Services: Provided in root, constructor-based DI
- Subscription management: Initialize as null, unsubscribe in ngOnDestroy
- No console.log: Use LoggerService instead

## User Preferences

- When starting, use the list_files tool to list the files in the context directory and the docs directory. Read any of those files that are relevant to the current prompt.
- When making changes to any file:
  - Always run lint with "pnpm run lint:all" and fix any lint errors related to changes you made
    - When fixing lint errors about unused items, remove the unused item rather than prefixing with an underscore, unless the item is commented as a placeholder for future functionality
  - If the file contained executable code, run a build with "pnpm run build" and fix any build errors
    - Never complete a task if there are any remaining build errors
  - If the file was a test file, run the test using the proper vitest syntax (path to test file in double quotes) and fix any test errors.
    - Never disable or skip tests or suppress test errors. If you encounter a test error, fix the test or the code that is causing the error, or ask the user for guidance
- Always stop and prompt the user before running the application. The user usually already has an instance of the application running on http://localhost:4200
