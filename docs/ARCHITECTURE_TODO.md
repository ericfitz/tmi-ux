## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Phase 5: Additional Architectural Improvements (Low Priority)

#### 5.1 Improve Error Handling
- [ ] Create centralized error handling service
- [ ] Implement consistent error boundaries
- [ ] Standardize error notification patterns

#### 5.2 State Management Review
- [ ] Evaluate if RxJS subjects are sufficient or if NgRx is needed
- [ ] Document state management patterns
- [ ] Create guidelines for when to use component vs service state

#### 5.3 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for all feature modules
- [ ] Add preload strategies for critical routes
- [ ] Optimize change detection strategies
- [ ] Review and optimize RxJS subscription patterns

## ‚úÖ Post-Migration Improvements (Completed 2025-09-05)

### Steps 1-5: Code Quality and Organization
- [x] **Step 1**: Remove unused imports and configure ESLint
  - Configured ESLint with eslint-plugin-unused-imports
  - Added rules to automatically catch and remove unused imports
  
- [x] **Step 2**: Standardize file naming conventions
  - Renamed service files to follow .service.ts convention
  - Created comprehensive NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md documentation
  - Updated imports across the codebase
  
- [x] **Step 3**: Verify bundle size improvements
  - Created BUNDLE_SIZE_ANALYSIS.md with detailed metrics
  - Initial bundle: 1.13 MB (267.70 kB compressed)
  - Tree-shaking now enabled for all components
  
- [x] **Step 4**: Update component tests for new imports
  - Updated test harness to support standalone components
  - All 823 tests passing successfully
  
- [x] **Step 5**: Code organization (interfaces, services, barrel exports)
  - Created barrel exports for core services
  - Created barrel exports for auth services and guards
  - Created barrel exports for DFD domain value objects

## üéØ Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)

1. **Additional code organization**
   - [ ] Create barrel exports for remaining feature modules
   - [ ] Move shared interfaces to core/interfaces
   - [ ] Group related utilities in sub-folders

## üö® Technical Debt to Address

1. **Architecture Violations** (High Priority)
   - Core services importing from feature modules
   - See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATIONS.md` for detailed list and resolution plan
   - ApiService ‚Üí AuthService dependency
   - DfdCollaborationService ‚Üí AuthService & ThreatModelService dependencies

2. **WebSocket Service Organization**
   - The WebSocket-related services are split between core and DFD
   - Consider creating a dedicated WebSocket module or consolidating in core

3. **Notification Service Duplication**
   - Two notification services exist (shared and DFD-specific)
   - Consider consolidating or clearly separating responsibilities

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Add integration tests for the new abstraction layer
   - Add tests for service provisioning patterns
   - Ensure standalone component migration doesn't break tests

5. **Authorization Service Placement**
   - ThreatModelAuthorizationService might belong in core if used across features
   - Review and relocate if necessary

## üìä Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero circular dependencies (validate with `madge` or similar tool)
- [ ] All components use standalone API
- [ ] No NgModules except for third-party libraries
- [ ] Clean dependency graph with no upward dependencies
- [ ] All architectural rules pass in CI/CD

## üîß Tooling Recommendations

1. **Install architecture validation tools**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev madge
   npm install --save-dev dependency-cruiser
   ```

2. **Add scripts to package.json**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "architecture:check": "madge --circular src/",
       "architecture:graph": "madge --image graph.svg src/"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Configure pre-commit hooks**
   - Use husky to run architecture checks
   - Prevent commits that violate architecture rules

## üìÖ Suggested Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Phase 3 (Standalone Migration)
- **Week 2**: Complete Phase 4 (Documentation)
- **Week 3**: Address quick wins and technical debt
- **Ongoing**: Phase 5 improvements as time permits

## üìù Notes

- Always run `pnpm test` after architectural changes
- Update documentation as you make changes
- Consider the impact on other developers and CI/CD pipelines
- Prioritize changes that provide immediate value to the development team

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Migration Notes
- **Component Testing**: When migrating components to use new import constants, ensure all component tests are updated accordingly
- **Tree Shaking**: The new import pattern enables better tree shaking - monitor bundle sizes after migration
- **IDE Support**: Some IDEs may not auto-import from `@app/shared/imports` - developers might need to manually add imports initially
- **Circular Dependencies**: Be careful not to create circular dependencies when using barrel exports

### Next Steps After Phase 3.2
- **Verify Bundle Size**: Check if the migration has reduced bundle sizes due to better tree shaking
- **Update Developer Onboarding**: Ensure new developers understand the import constant pattern
- **Consider NgModules**: Some third-party libraries still require NgModules - plan for these exceptions
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure migrated components maintain their test coverage
