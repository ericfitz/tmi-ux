# History Mechanism Restoration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to restore clean history functionality in the DFD component after the recent architecture rework. The goal is to recreate the sophisticated history filtering and atomic operation grouping that existed before rearchitecture while maintaining the new clean architecture patterns.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- Basic filtering logic exists in `GraphHistoryCoordinator` and `_shouldIncludeInHistory()`
- Some atomic operations are properly wrapped with `executeAtomicOperation()`
- Visual effects are excluded via attribute path filtering
- History disable/enable mechanisms are in place

### Key Issues Identified

#### 1. Missing Drag Completion Tracking
- **Problem**: Current implementation lacks the sophisticated drag completion tracking that existed pre-rearchitecture
- **Impact**: Move and resize operations create multiple history entries instead of final-state-only entries
- **Pre-rearchitecture**: Had `dragCompleted$` observable with duration tracking and final position capture

#### 2. Incomplete Atomic Operation Wrapping
- **Problem**: Many operations that should be atomic are not properly wrapped
- **Examples**: 
  - Multi-select deletions may not be batched
  - Z-order changes via context menu aren't atomic
  - Collaboration session operations lack proper grouping
- **Pre-rearchitecture**: Used `GraphHistoryCoordinator.executeAtomicOperation()` with operation types

#### 3. Missing Operation-Specific Filtering
- **Problem**: Current filtering is generic; lacks operation-type awareness
- **Pre-rearchitecture**: Had `HISTORY_OPERATION_TYPES` with specific filtering per operation type
- **Impact**: Visual effects during legitimate operations may leak into history

#### 4. Insufficient Collaboration Support
- **Problem**: Remote operations during collaboration sessions aren't properly grouped as single atomic operations
- **Impact**: WebSocket message processing creates multiple history entries instead of one per diagram operation

#### 5. Incomplete Event Coordination
- **Problem**: Current implementation has commented-out selection handling and lacks proper event sequencing
- **Pre-rearchitecture**: Had sophisticated event coordination between visual effects, history, and port visibility

## Desired Behavior

### History Should Capture Only:
1. **Add cell**: Single entry when user adds a node or edge
2. **Delete cell**: Single entry when user deletes one or more cells (batched if multiple)
3. **Resize cell**: Single entry with final size after user stops dragging a handle
4. **Move cell**: Single entry with final location after user stops dragging
5. **Change label**: Single entry after user finishes editing text
6. **Z-order changes**: Single entry when user chooses context menu items (move to front, etc.)
7. **Edge vertex changes**: Single entry with final vertex positions after drag completion
8. **Edge connection changes**: Single entry when user changes which port an edge connects to
9. **Add inverse edge**: Single atomic entry grouping all changes to selected edge and new edge
10. **Collaboration operations**: Single entry per diagram operation message received

### History Should NOT Capture:
1. Initial diagram render when loading existing diagram
2. Visual effects (selection styling, hover effects, shadows, filters)
3. Port visibility changes
4. Interim locations/sizes during drag operations
5. X6 tools added/removed
6. Select/unselect related changes
7. Changes during undo/redo operations
8. Remote operations during collaboration (don't create local history)

- Add `executeRemoteOperation()` wrapper for collaboration

### Phase 3: Restore Complete Event Coordination

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] **Final state only**: Move/resize operations create single history entry with final state
- [x] **Atomic multi-operations**: Multi-select delete, add inverse edge, collaboration operations are single history entries  
- [x] **Clean undo/redo**: Undo/redo operations themselves don't create history entries
- [x] **Visual effect exclusion**: Selection, hover, port visibility, tools don't appear in history
- [x] **Collaboration support**: Remote operations are properly grouped and don't create local history

### Technical Requirements
- [x] **Minimal performance impact**: History mechanism shouldn't slow down normal operations
- [x] **Architecture compliance**: Maintains clean separation between layers
- [x] **Robust error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures
- [x] **Comprehensive testing**: All scenarios covered by integration tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental implementation**: Implement each phase incrementally with testing
2. **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality isn't broken during transition
3. **Test-driven development**: Write/update tests before implementing changes
4. **Performance monitoring**: Monitor impact on performance throughout implementation

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental rollout**: Implement behind feature flags where possible
2. **Comprehensive testing**: Both unit and integration tests for each phase
3. **Performance benchmarking**: Establish baselines and monitor throughout
4. **Rollback plan**: Clear rollback strategy for each phase

## Maintenance and Future Considerations

### Code Organization
- Keep history logic centralized in `GraphHistoryCoordinator`
- Maintain clear separation between visual effects and business logic
- Document all filtering rules and atomic operation types

### Testing Strategy  
- Integration tests for complex scenarios (multi-select, collaboration)
- Unit tests for filtering logic
- Performance tests for history operations
- Manual testing for user experience validation

### Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing operation replay for debugging
- Add history operation analytics/telemetry
- Explore more sophisticated operation detection algorithms
- Consider implementing history compression for large diagrams
